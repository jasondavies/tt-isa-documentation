# Debug Daisychain

The debug daisychain can be used to present various internal signals from the Tensix tile, in groups of 128 bits. Most of these signals relate to internal implementation details of the Wormhole chip and are only meaningful to Tenstorrent engineers, but some of the signals are potentially useful to customers building a low level debugger, and those are described here.

## `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG`

Software writes to this register to control the debug daisychain.

|First&nbsp;bit|#&nbsp;Bits|Name|Purpose|
|--:|--:|---|---|
|0|16|`SignalSel`|In combination with `DaisySel`, selects which 128 bits of debug data to present on the debug daisychain.|
|16|8|`DaisySel`|In combination with `SignalSel`, selects which 128 bits of debug data to present on the debug daisychain.|
|24|1|Reserved||
|25|2|`Read32Sel`|Selects which 32-bits of the 128-bit debug data are presented in `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA`: `0` for bits 0 through 31, `1` for bits 32 through 63, `2` for bits 64 through 95, `3` for bits 96 through 127.|
|27|2|Reserved||
|29|1|`Enabled`|Must be set to `true` to use the debug daisychain. Should be set to `false` at all other times to conserve power.|
|30|2|Reserved||

After changing the values in `Enabled` or `DaisySel` or `SignalSel`, software should wait at least five cycles before trying to obtain data from the debug daisychain. Software should also expect that any data obtained from the debug daisychain is at least five cycles stale. Data can be obtained in one of three ways:
* Software can read 32 bits by reading from `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA`.
* Software can instruct the daisychain to write 128 bits to an aligned address in the low 1 MiB of L1.
* Software can instruct the daisychain to sample 128 bits every N cycles and write the samples out to consecutive aligned addresses in the low 1 MiB of L1.

## `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA`

Once the `Enabled`, `DaisySel`, and `SignalSel` fields of `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG` have been set to select a group of 128 bits to present on the debug daisychain, and software has waited at least five cycles, that data is continuously available on `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA` for software to read. As `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA` is only 32 bits wide, the `Read32Sel` field of `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG` controls which 32 bits of the 128 bits are presented on `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA`. Software does not need to wait five cycles after changing `Read32Sel`. As the data on the daisychain can be continuously changing, software should not expect to be able to perform a consistent read of 128 bits by cycling through `Read32Sel` - software needs to instruct the daisychain to write out to L1 if it wants all 128 bits to come from the same point in time.

If a RISCV core is writing to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG` and then reading from `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA`, then the programmer should be aware of [RISCV memory ordering](BabyRISCV/MemoryOrdering.md), and the programmer needs to ensure that the write-request to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG` is emitted before the read-request from `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA`. One possible safe instruction sequence is:
```
sw t1, 0(t0) # Store to RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG
sw x0, 0(t2) # Store to RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA (just for ordering, the value will be discarded)
sw x0, 0(t2) # Store to RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA (just for ordering, the value will be discarded)
lw t3, 0(t2) # Load from RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_RD_DATA
```

## `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2`

Once the `Enabled`, `DaisySel`, and `SignalSel` fields of `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG` have been set to select a group of 128 bits to present on the debug daisychain, and software has waited at least five cycles, software can instruct the daisychain to write 128 bits out to an aligned address in the low 1 MiB of L1. This is controlled using `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2`:

|First&nbsp;bit|#&nbsp;Bits|Name|
|--:|--:|---|
|0|4|`WriteMode`|
|4|8|`SamplingInterval`|
|12|1|`WriteTrigger`|
|13|19|Reserved|

To prepare the daisychain for writing 128 bits out to L1, software should:
1. Write to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2` with `WriteMode == 0xf` and other fields zero.
2. Write `x >> 4` to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG0`, where `x` is the byte-address in L1 it wishes the daisychain to write to.
3. Write to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2` with `WriteMode == 0` or `WriteMode == 1`, and other fields zero.

Once prepared, to instruct the daisychain to write 128 bits to L1, software should:
1. Write to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2`, changing `WriteTrigger` from `false` to `true`, leaving all other fields constant. This transition will trigger a write event. The write event will normally happen instantly, but in the case of extreme contention on L1, it could take up to 200 cycles.
2. Write to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2`, changing `WriteTrigger` from `true` to `false`, leaving all other fields constant. This is in preparation for next write. If `WriteMode == 0`, then the next write will be to same address `x`, whereas if `WriteMode == 1`, then the next write will be to 16 bytes after the previous write.

To get a series of regular samples of 128 bits written out to L1, software should:
1. Write to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2` with `WriteMode == 0xf` and other fields zero.
2. Write `x >> 4` to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG0`, where `x` is the byte-address in L1 it wishes the daisychain to start writing to.
3. Write `(x >> 4) + c` to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG1`, where `c` is the number of samples software wishes to take.
4. Write to `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_L1_MEM_REG2` with `WriteMode == 4`, `SamplingInterval` set to `N - 1` to get a sample every `N` cycles, and `WriteTrigger == true`. Due to a hardware bug, if `N == 1`, hardware _might_ take one more sample than requested, so software is advised to use `N â‰¥ 2`. This bug notwithstanding, hardware will take `c` samples total. It will try to take a sample every `N` cycles: if the L1 write interface is available when it wants to take a sample, then a sample will be taken at that time, and if not, it'll try again in `N` cycles time. If L1 is busy when it wants to take a sample, it'll still take `c` samples total, but the samples will not be from equally-spaced points in time.

The `LaneEnabled` state of the Vector Unit (SFPU) can be presented on the debug daisychain when `DaisySel == 7` and `SignalSel == 28`, although a 4x8 transpose is applied between the bit number and the lane number:

> [!CAUTION]
> The `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG.Enabled` control signal only flows into the Vector Unit (SFPU) when the Matrix Unit (FPU) clock is active. If software wishes to use the debug daisychain to observe `LaneEnabled`, then **after** setting `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_DBG_BUS_CNTL_REG.Enabled` to `true`, it needs to activate the Matrix Unit (FPU) clock for at least one cycle. This can be done by disabling the clock gater, or by executing any Vector Unit (SFPU) instruction (for example `SFPNOP`).
